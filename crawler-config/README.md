# Data sources - DEPRECATED

The crawler has moved to it's open repo:

https://github.com/ansible-community/stats-crawler/

This file still exists while I check if it is in use anywhere else, but it should not be further updated. The new crawler repo is designed to be more flexible and will be a point of collection for all the stats config going forward.
